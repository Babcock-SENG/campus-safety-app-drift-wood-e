# Campus Safety App - Software Proposal

## Title: Campus Safety App - Software Proposal  
- **Group Name**: Drift Wood-E  

---

## Introduction
The campus safety app is a mobile app being designed to enhance campus safety by providing quick access to security services allowing students to have access to emergency contacts, security updates, and a real-time safety map. Students will be able to communicate instantly with campus security, access emergency contacts, and receive critical updates during emergencies. The target audience includes students, campus security personnel, and university administrators.

---

## Summary
The campus safety app is a mobile app being designed to enhance campus safety by providing quick access to security services allowing students to have access to emergency contacts, security updates, and a real-time safety map. Exclusive features such as the panic button, geo-location sharing, and a live chat with emergency contacts will be used to achieve the app's main goal of enhancing safety all over campus.

Due to the tight time constraint and minimal client feedback used to create this project, the Scrum Agile methodology was used because it enables iterative development and internal testing and feedback between the team. The key deliverables in this project will be a requirement analysis, use case diagram and scenario analysis, a paper prototype, Gantt chart, risk analysis, software proposal, and a link to the live landing page.

## Problem Statement
During emergency situations, many students find it hard to contact or get their location across to campus security due to the lack of a method of communication.  

---

## Objectives
1. To serve as an immediate line of communication between students and campus security.  
2. Provide access to emergency contacts, safety alerts, and location-based services.  
3. Allow geo-location sharing to reduce emergency response time.  
4. Deliver real-time safety alerts and notifications to students about security threats.

## Scope

### Features:
1. **Panic Button**: A one-tap emergency alert system that sends an emergency notification and user’s location to campus security and emergency contacts.  
2. **Live Chat**: A communication feature enabling students to chat with campus security and each other in real-time.  
3. **Push Notifications**: Push notifications with updates on safety-related incidents.  
4. **Geolocation Sharing**: Allows students to send their location to security and emergency contacts during an emergency for easier tracking.  
5. **User Authentication**: Secure login using Firebase Authentication.  

### Technologies:
